# Grid
The grid is configured by setting `config.grid` to an instance of the `Block` class in `job.py`.
For example:
```
config.grid = Block(
    file_name = "grid.su2",
    initial_condition = initial_state,
    boundaries = {
        "inflow": supersonic_inflow(inflow_state),
        "outflow": supersonic_outflow(),
        "wall": slip_wall()
    }
)
```

`config.grid` must be set, there is no default value.

The settings are described below.

## file_name
The name of the grid file.
`ibis` has no grid generation capabilities, so this must be generated by some other software.
> Type: `String`\
> Default: None

## initial_condition
The initial condition to fill the grid with.
> Type: [FlowState](/docs/reference_manual/gas_model#FlowState)\
> Default: None

## boundaries
A dictionary of the boundary conditions to attach to the grid.
The grid file should have some boundary tags associated with it.
These boundary tags are the keys in the dictionary, and the values are the `ibis` boundary conditions.
The available boundary conditions are described [here](/docs/reference_manual/boundary_conditions).
> Type: `dict`: {`String`: `BoundaryCondition`}\
> Default: None
